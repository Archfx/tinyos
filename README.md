# TinyOSüêû

TinyOSis a tutorial series about minimal operating system kernel implementation based on the comprehensive tutorial series [mini-risscv-os](https://github.com/cccriscv/mini-riscv-os). This operating system kernel is based on [RISC-V](https://github.com/riscv). instrucion set architecture. Credits to the original authors. A fully built environment is available as a docker environment. This tutorial will cover  several chapters related to implementing a operating system from begining.

## Requirements

In order to complete the tutorial you just need only two things

1. [TinyOS repo](https://github.com/archfx/tinyos)
2. [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

Beyond the technical requirements, inorder to understand the concepts I highly recommend looking at my [firmware tutorial](https://archfx.github.io/posts/2023/02/firmware1/) series before starting on this.

## Setup the Environement on Docker

Fully bulid docker environemt with all the requirements installed including 

- gcc toolchain
- qemu with RISC-V simulator

can be found in the following docker-hub reposiroty.

<p align="center"><a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/archfx/rv32i"><img src="https://dockerico.blankenship.io/image/archfx/rv32i"/></a></p>


You can follow the below instructions to get it mount on your docker stack.

```shell
docker pull archfx/rv32i:qemu # pull the docker container
git clone https://github.com/Archfx/tinyos #clone this repository
docker run -t -p 6080:6080 -v "${PWD}/:/tinyos" -w /tinyos --name rv32i archfx/rv32i:qemu #Mount the repo to the docker container

# Opern another terminal 
docker exec -it rv32i /bin/bash
```

## Building and Simulation

- Changes the current working directory to the specified one and then

```shell
make # Build the OS
make qemu # Simulate the OS
```

Note: `Press Ctrl-A and then X to exit QEMU`
