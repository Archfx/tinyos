# HelloWorld I/O program

Welcome to the first and simplest episode of **TinyOS**üêû. In this episode we will be looking at memory map settings of QEMU and writing a simple `HelloWorld` program. If you missed the introduction article about TinyOSüêû, you can find it [here](https://archfx.github.io/posts/2023/08/tinyos0/).



## Main File (os.c)
Let's start with the core code related to the HelloWorld. You can find the file [here](https://github.com/Archfx/tinyos/blob/master/01-HelloWorld/os.c).

```c
#include <stdint.h>

#define UART        0x10000000
#define UART_THR    (uint8_t*)(UART+0x00) // THR:transmitter holding register
#define UART_LSR    (uint8_t*)(UART+0x05) // LSR:line status register
#define UART_LSR_EMPTY_MASK 0x40          // LSR Bit 6: Transmitter empty; both the THR and LSR are empty

int lib_putc(char ch) {
	while ((*UART_LSR & UART_LSR_EMPTY_MASK) == 0);
	return *UART_THR = ch;
}

void lib_puts(char *s) {
	while (*s) lib_putc(*s++);
}

int os_main(void)
{
	lib_puts("Hello OS!\n");
	while (1) {}
	return 0;
}
```

The preset RISC-V virtual machine in QEMU is called virt, and the UART memory mapping location starts from 0x10000000, and the mapping registers are as follows:


### UART MemoryMapped IO

|------------|-----|------------------------------|
| 0x10000000 | THR | Transmitter Holding Register |
| 0x10000000 | RHR | Receive Holding Register     |
| 0x10000001 | IER | Interrupt Enable Register    |
| 0x10000002 | ISR |Interrupt Status Register     |
| 0x10000003 | LCR | Line Control Register        |
| 0x10000004 | MCR | Modem Control Register       |
| 0x10000005 | LSR | Line Status Register         |
| 0x10000006 | MSR | Modem Status Register        |
| 0x10000007 | SPR | Scratch Pad Register         |


As long as we send a certain character to the THR of the UART, the character can be printed out, but before sending it, we must confirm whether the sixth bit of the LSR is 1 (meaning that the UART transmission area is empty and can be transmitted).


THR Bit 6: Transmitter empty; both the THR and shift register are empty if this is set.


So we wrote the following function to send a character to the UART for printing out to the host. (Because the embedded system usually does not have a display device, it will be sent back to the host for display)

```c
int lib_putc(char ch) {
	while ((*UART_LSR & UART_LSR_EMPTY_MASK) == 0);
	return *UART_THR = ch;
}
```

Once a word can be printed, a large string of words can be printed with the following lib_puts(s).

```c
void lib_puts(char *s) {
	while (*s) lib_putc(*s++);
}
```

So our main program calls lib_puts to print `Hello World!`.

```c
int os_main(void)
{
	lib_puts("Hello World!\n");
	while (1) {}
	return 0;
}
```

Although our main program is only a short 22 lines, the 01-HelloOs project includes not only the main program, but also the startup program start.s, the link file os.ld, and the configuration file Makefile.

## Project build configuration file Makefile

The Makefile in mini-riscv-os is usually similar, the following is the Makefile of 01-HelloOs.

```makefile
CC = riscv32-unknown-elf-gcc
CFLAGS = -nostdlib -fno-builtin -mcmodel=medany -march=rv32ima -mabi=ilp32

QEMU = qemu-system-riscv32
QFLAGS = -nographic -smp 4 -machine virt -bios none

OBJDUMP = riscv32-unknown-elf-objdump

all: os.elf

os.elf: start.s os.c
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -T os.ld -o os.elf $^

qemu: $(TARGET)
	@qemu-system-riscv32 -M ? | grep virt >/dev/null || exit
	@echo "Press Ctrl-A and then X to exit QEMU"
	$(QEMU) $(QFLAGS) -kernel os.elf

clean:
	rm -f *.elf
```

Some of the Makefile syntax is not easy to understand, especially the following symbols:


- `$@` : the target file for this rule (Target file)

- `$*` : represents the files specified by targets, but does not contain the file extension

- `$<` : the first dependency file in the list of dependency files (Dependencies file)

- `$^` : all dependent files in the dependent file list

- `$?` : A list of files in the dependent file list that are newer than the target file

- `$*` : represents the files specified by targets, but does not contain the file extension

- `?=` Syntax: If the variable is undefined, assign it a new value.

- `:=` Syntax: make will expand the entire Makefile and then determine the value of the variable.


So the following two lines in the above Makefile:

```makefile
os.elf: start.s os.c
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -T os.ld -o os.elf $^
```

The `$^` in it is replaced by `start.s os.c`, so the entire line `$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -T os.ld -o os.elf $^` becomes the following instructions.

```
riscv32-unknown-elf-gcc -nostdlib -fno-builtin -mcmodel=medany -march=rv32ima -mabi=ilp32 -T os.ld -o os.elf start.s os.c
```

In the Makefile, we use `riscv32-unknown-elf-gcc` to compile, and then use `qemu-system-riscv32` to execute. The execution process of program is as follows:

```shell
cd 01-HelloWorld
$ make clean
```
<code>rm -f *.elf</code>

```shell
$ make
```
<code>riscv32-unknown-elf-gcc -nostdlib -fno-builtin -mcmodel=medany -march=rv32ima -mabi=ilp32 -T os.ld -o os.elf start.s os.c</code>

```shell
$ make qemu
```

<code>Press Ctrl-A and then X to exit QEMU <br>
qemu-system-riscv32 -nographic -smp 4 -machine virt -bios none -kernel os.elf<br>
Hello World!<br>
QEMU: Terminated
</code>

First use make clean to clear the last compilation output, then use make to call the riscv32-unknown-elf-gcc compilation project, the following is the complete compilation instruction

```shell
 riscv32-unknown-elf-gcc -nostdlib -fno-builtin -mcmodel=medany -march=rv32ima -mabi=ilp32 -T os.ld -o os.elf start.s os.c
```

Among them, `-march=rv32ima` means that we want to [generate code for 32-bit I+M+A instruction set](https://www.sifive.com/blog/all-aboard-part-1-compiler-args) :


- I: Basic Integer Instruction Set (Integer)
- M: Include multiplication and division (Multiply)
- A: Contains atomic instructions (Atomic)
- C: Use 16-bit compression (Compact) -- Note: We did not add C, so the instruction machine code generated is purely 32-bit instructions, not compressed into 16-bit, because we want the instruction length to be the same, from the beginning to the end The tail is 32 bits.

And `-mabi=ilp32` indicates that the integer of the generated binary object code is based on a 32-bit architecture.

- ilp32: int, long, and pointers are all 32-bits long. long long is a 64-bit type, char is 8-bit, and short is 16-bit.
- lp64: long and pointers are 64-bits long, while int is a 32-bit type. The other types remain the same as ilp32.

There is also the `-mcmodel=medany` parameter, which means that the generated symbol address must be within 2GB, and can be addressed by static linking.

- `-mcmodel=medany`: Generate code for the medium-any code model. The program and its statically defined symbols must be within any single 2 GiB address range. Programs can be statically or dynamically linked.

More detailed RISC-V gcc parameters can be found from [here](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/RISC-V-Options.html)

In addition, the two parameters `-nostdlib -fno-builtin` are used to indicate that the standard library should not be linked (because it is an embedded system, the library usually needs to be self-made), please refer to the [here](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Link-Options.html) for more details:



## Link Script link file (os.ld)

There is also the `-T os.ld` parameter specifying the link script as the os.ld file as follows: (link script is a guide file describing how to put the program segment TEXT, data segment DATA and BSS uninitialized data segment into the memory respectively)

```c
OUTPUT_ARCH( "riscv" )

ENTRY( _start )

MEMORY
{
  ram   (wxa!ri) : ORIGIN = 0x80000000, LENGTH = 128M
}

PHDRS
{
  text PT_LOAD;
  data PT_LOAD;
  bss PT_LOAD;
}

SECTIONS
{
  .text : {
    PROVIDE(_text_start = .);
    *(.text.init) *(.text .text.*)
    PROVIDE(_text_end = .);
  } >ram AT>ram :text

  .rodata : {
    PROVIDE(_rodata_start = .);
    *(.rodata .rodata.*)
    PROVIDE(_rodata_end = .);
  } >ram AT>ram :text

  .data : {
    . = ALIGN(4096);
    PROVIDE(_data_start = .);
    *(.sdata .sdata.*) *(.data .data.*)
    PROVIDE(_data_end = .);
  } >ram AT>ram :data

  .bss :{
    PROVIDE(_bss_start = .);
    *(.sbss .sbss.*) *(.bss .bss.*)
    PROVIDE(_bss_end = .);
  } >ram AT>ram :bss

  PROVIDE(_memory_start = ORIGIN(ram));
  PROVIDE(_memory_end = ORIGIN(ram) + LENGTH(ram));
}
```

## Start the program (start.s)

In addition to the main program, an embedded system usually needs a startup program written in assembly language. The content of the startup program start.s in 01-HelloOs is as follows: are asleep, which makes things simpler and does not need to consider too many parallel processing issues).
 
```c
.equ STACK_SIZE, 8192

.global _start

_start:
    # setup stacks per hart
    csrr t0, mhartid                # read current hart id
    slli t0, t0, 10                 # shift left the hart id by 1024
    la   sp, stacks + STACK_SIZE    # set the initial stack pointer 
                                    # to the end of the stack space
    add  sp, sp, t0                 # move the current hart stack pointer
                                    # to its place in the stack space

    # park harts with id != 0
    csrr a0, mhartid                # read current hart id
    bnez a0, park                   # if we're not on the hart 0
                                    # we park the hart

    j    os_main                    # hart 0 jump to c

park:
    wfi
    j park

stacks:
    .skip STACK_SIZE * 4            # allocate space for the harts stacks

```

## Execute with QEMU

And when you enter make qemu, Make will execute the following commands

```
qemu-system-riscv32 -nographic -smp 4 -machine virt -bios none -kernel os.elf
```

It means to use `qemu-system-riscv32` to execute the os.elf kernel file, `-bios none` does not use basic input and output bios, `-nographic` does not use drawing mode, and the specified machine architecture is `-machine virt`, also It is the RISC-V virtual machine virt preset by QEMU.

So when you enter `make qemu`, you will see the following screen!
```shell
$ make qemu
```
<code>
Press Ctrl-A and then X to exit QEMU</br>
qemu-system-riscv32 -nographic -smp 4 -machine virt -bios none -kernel os.elf<br>
Hello World!<br>
QEMU: Terminated
</code>

This is the basic appearance of the simplest Hello Wolrd! program in the TinyOS series.
